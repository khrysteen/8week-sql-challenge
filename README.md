# 8week-sql-challenge
This 8-Week SQL Challenge was curated by Danny Ma in order to aid data analysts and SQL enthusiasts have a practise ground in order to hone their skills. It was one of the first projects I undertook as a data analyst in SQL and it helped me learn a lot of functions in SQL such as:Window functions for ranking, common table expressions, cpmplex joins and much more. I hope this will encourage you to take a step and dive into this project.
